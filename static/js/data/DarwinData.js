I have rather a wild bit of speculation afloat on the crossing of plants; & the Leguminosæ are my determined enemies, & worst of all are any forest-trees of this order. Now the only book which I have as any sort of guide is Loudon Encyclop. of Plants; & as far as I can most imperfectly judge; the Leguminosæ in the two sub-orders Cæsalpinieæ & Mimoseæ are mostly Trees or bushes— is this so? But what concerns me most is to know whether there are many timber trees with papilionaceous flowers, ie with a keel enclosing the stamens & pistil, so as to shut them up as in a common Pea.— In Loudon to my joy the little woodcuts seem to show that the trees Dipterix, Parivoa & Erythrina have the stamens protruding, unlike common papilionaceous flowers:— on the other hand, to my sorrow the trees Dalbergia Pongamia, Pterocarpus, Butea & Piscidia have flowers shut up just like a Pea.— Do you know these trees, & is my inference right? And can you say, whether the papilionaceous division of the Leguminosæ have as many trees as the two other divisions; or (but this is a very loose question) as many trees as most orders which have any trees?"

I have no doubt that you will detect blunders of many kinds in my book. Your M.S. on the proportion of the sexes at birth seems to me extremely curious, & I hope that someday you will publish it. It certainly appears that the male are decreasing in the London districts, & a most strange fact it is. M. Graham, however, I observe in a note enclosed does not seem inclined to admit your conclusion. I have never much considered the subject of the the causes of the proportion. When I reflected on queen-Bees producing only males when not impregnated, whilst some other parthenogenetic insects produced, as far as known only females, the subject seemed to me hopelessly obscure. It is, however, pretty clear that you have taken the one path for its solution. I wished only to ascertain how far with various animals the males exceeded the females, & I have given all the facts which I could collect. As far as I know no other data have been published. The equality of the Sexes with race-horses is surprising. My remarks on mankind are quite superficial, & given merely as some sort of standard for comparison with the lower animals. M. Thury is the writer who makes the Sex depend on the period of impregnation. His pamphlet was sent me from Geneva. I can lend it you if you like. I subsequently read an account of experiments which convinced me that M. Thury was in error; but I cannot remember what they were, only the impression that I might safely banish this view from my mind. Your remarks on the less ratio of Males in illegitimate births strikes me as the most doubtful point in your M.S.—requiring two assumptions, viz. that the fathers in such cases are relatively too young, & that the result is the same as when the father is relatively too old."

But if he has not, I would not in my own case quote his observations as in the least trustworthy."

It would be a great gain even to stop the spread of Slavery into the Territories:—if that be possible without abolition, which I sh. have doubted. You ought not to wonder so much at England’s coldness, when you recollect at the commencement of the war how many propositions were made to get things back to the old state with the old line of Latitude.— But enough of this: all I can say is that Massachussetts & the adjoining States have the full sympathy of every good man whom I see; & this sympathy would be extended to whole Federal states, if we could be persuaded that your feelings were at all common to them.— But enough of this.

The Sethia is a beautiful case of what I shall call “reciprocal dimorphism”: unfortunately all the anthers were knocked off the long-styled, so I could not compare pollen, except from a bud in which pollen was not mature, & I dare not trust my measurements. If you were to watch insects visiting these flowers I would wager that you would see body dusted by long stamens, & probosis by short anthers; & the object of unequal length of the alternate stamens is to get pollen on to proboscis from more than a pair of anthers; in short to rake them. I judge this from what I have seen in Lythrum. Are there any Lythraceæ in Ceylon; you would be likely to find  forms, reciprocally related in sexual functions, in this order; & with two kinds of pollen in each flower. If you observe any more facts, I sh. be grateful for information & specimens. I have also been  glad to see the Limnanthemum: it, also, is a very pretty case.

Therefore he concludes that the specimens analysed by Capt Parsons must certainly have become penetrated with surface mud. This seems to remove the wonderful difficulty of the layer of mould not being thicker at the bottom of your valley.

I have the particulars of one case in which one var. of common pea was raised for a number of generations near other peas and yet kept true. From the action of Bees and from analogy the whole case perplexes me much. Perhaps if you come across any nursery gardener you will enquire whether they have actually known adjoining vars. to cross."

I earnestly hope that before long I may have strength to study the work as it ought to be studied, for I am certain to find or refind much that is deeply interesting. In many parts of your Principles of Biology I was fairly astonished at the prodigality of your original views. Most of the chapters furnished suggestions for whole volumes of future researches. As I have heard that you have changed your residence I am forced to address this to Messrs. Williams & Norgate; and for the same reason I gave some time ago the same address to M. Murray for a copy of my book on Variation etc which is now finished but delayed by the index-maker."

The double end seems to be attained in those numerous species whose brightly-coloured hindwings are covered by the dull forewings when the creature is dormant or at rest, but can readily be displayed on occasion. The dull underside of many Butterflies in conjunction with a brilliant upperside seems to afford similar evidence."

I like the critique very much in the main; partly no doubt, from the fact that I couldn’t get on at all with Mivart’s book when I tried to read it. I think that M. Wright very fairly points out Mivart’s deficiency in the mental grasp and range necessary for dealing with the great subject of your works. For my own part, I confess I could not follow the arguments in many parts of the “Genesis”, and where I could follow them I usually thought them weak if not fallacious. M. Wright’s illustration (p. 20) of the “obstructed path” across a field strikes me as a good one. Where he seems to me, however, to have quite lost his head is (at pp. 35–36) in his treatment of the Gospel record of Our Lord’s conversation with Nicodemus. It is inconceivable to me how anybody can expect to strengthen a scientific argument by quoting a few detached expressions from passages of the Scriptures which in their entirety deal with wholly different matters."

With regard to the disintegration of rocks under a coating or bed of turf, I imagine it would depend very greatly on the nature of the rocks themselves— some rocks such as the more calcareous (or marley) ones or sandstones cemented together by calcareous matter would I believe decompose and break up more rapidly under turf by the dissolving action of the vegetable acids contained in it as also of the water which would most probably be under these circumstances, more highly charged with carbonic acid— Other rocks however such as the hard gneiss quartzites and granitic ones would I think be protected by the bed of turf—for their disintegration goes on very slowly unless assisted by external weathering agencies—particularly frost— The organic acids or carbonic acid have little or no action on quartzites or highly silicated rocks—but attack the felspars containing lime somewhat energetically— When the rocks contain iron this metal would be rapidly taken up by water charged with organic acids or with carbonic acid or more strongly by both combined as the organic acids would first reduce the red oxide into pentoxide thus discharge the colour & bring the iron into a more soluble condition"

One had been used as a sepulcre and contained corpses buried in the sitting posture, fragments of coarse ware, flint chips and a most beautiful polished implement of greenstone. The last stamps the neolithic age of the whole series, and renders certain, what in my account I was obliged to leave doubtful. All three caves are close to the ridge of limestone from the cracks in which Miss Lloyd obtained the animal-bones. So far as I know these three cases are the only ones on record of a Neolithic interment in caves in Britain, while that in the cave at Cefn makes a 4."

After your letter came I remembered a young lady having told me their dog howled when particular tunes were played so I went off to see it, but after walking three miles I was told it was a dog they  had and that it was in Campbelton. She told me their ministers wife said their dog howled so off we set to get the dog, for in this case the minister had no piano, but we were told she ment her dog at home, her mothers dog in fact at Stirling. Then the minister who is a great wag began to tell me about a wonderful dog in St Andrews who used to pull the bell, and not only howl to music but played the piano and howled to his own playing. So I set off another day to find this wonderful animal. I found all he said about the dog was true, but he had been the property of Proff Macgill and the gentleman is dead and the dog is away   And now the Minister keeps teazing me about my novel hunt never failing to ask every time I meet him “Well have you caught the howling dog yet”   He has told several of the gentlemen in the neighbourhood too, who say “Oh by the way I have heard of a wonderful dog who howls, but he’s in Sky.” or some eaqually far away place. However though it has been a great amusement to , it has been very useful to me for the stories I have heard about dogs, is something extraordinary throwing  poor dog quite into the shade, and I shall be able to tell my friends in Edinburgh who doubt my story. We have both been ill with severe coughs but are getting better now   the season is very trying and it does not appear to be getting any better either."

After the lapse of so many years, I cannot pretend to describe them very accurately, especially as the sights in the room were too horrid for us to care to remain there many minutes   The impression left on my mind is, that the ears rose to an unusual height, and were  somewhat like this"

Do you not believe in the existence of Hell, as a place of torment for those who neglect that great salvation? What! not believe what He hath said who cannot lie?—who knoweth all things—after He has expressly declared that there is a bottomless pit of perdition into which all those who obey not His precepts will inevitably be cast? Are you not anxious to escape so deplorable a fate as that of consignment to the regions of everlasting woe? Oh! do let me entreat you not to defer for another moment, the all-momentous work of seeking to secure a personal interest in the blessings of eternal redemption! Are the conditions on which that participation in deliverance from eternal misery and destruction—that assurance of everlasting life and happiness,—that hope of future glory, safety, and enduring rapture—in which an individual interest in the blood and righteousness of Jesus Christ consists—are promised, too hard for you to comply with? Believe, and live! Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved? Are these terms too exacting? Oh! consider, my dear Sir, what Christ has suffered, in order that the way might be opened up for your return to your allegiance to Him in whom you live, and move, and have your being! Is it not enough that He left the glory which he had with the Father from all eternity, allied himself to our nature, lived a life of poverty and suffering—endured the contradiction of sinners against himself—agonized in Gethsemane to such a fearful degree as to sweat great drops of blood, therein,—was scourged—spit upon—arrayed, in mockery, with the habiliments of royalty, and the symbols of imperial sway—the crown (of thorns) and the sceptre (a reed; that he, the just One was led forth to execution—died the accursed death of the Cross—endured the withdrawal of his Father’s countenance and the dire anguish attendant thereon—constraining him to cry out—“My God! my God! why hast thou forsaken me?—” that he—standing as he then did in our stead, should have borne the outpourings of the vial of divine wrath against sin—in order that we might escape the endurance of the penalty due to our violations of Heaven’s law; that he, the just, should suffer for the unjust; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him? Surely there are motives powerful enough, here, to constrain you to love him; to serve him; to adore and magnify his precious name; to make an entire surrender of yourself to him—body, soul and spirit! Can you refrain from giving him your heart, after all he has suffered on your account. After such an exhibition of his love, and mercy, and grace, will you not be desirous to honour and glorify him? Has he not fully vindicated his claims to your trust and confidence, and to your obedience to the injunctions of his gospel? Let me again bring before your notice the inspired declarations—“God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on him might not perish, but have everlasting life”— “As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up, that whosoever believeth on him might not perish, but have everlasting life”. “For God sent not his Son into the world, to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be saved”. “Whosoever will, let him take of the water of life freely.” “I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance” “Whosoever calleth upon the name of the Lord shall be saved”— “The Son of Man is come to seek and to save them that are lost” “He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life.” Will you not then believe on him—and thus become the possessor of such a life? “Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord; though your sins be as scarlet they shall be as white as snow, though they be red like crimson, they shall become as wool” “Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return unto me and I will have mercy upon him, and will abundantly pardon him.” Now, my dear D. Darwin, let me, in conclusion, beg you, immediately after you have read this letter, to repair to your room, and there pour out your heart before God, by expressing to Him your earnest desire to become the recipient of all these transcendent blessings which he has promised in his holy word to all those who believe in His Son, and trust to him for salvation; or, if you have not the desire for such stupendous boons, to implore him to beget such a desire in your breast—and to grant you repentance towards God, and saving faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ. Now dont omit to do this—as you value your soul’s eternal safety and happiness!"

Still I thought the observations I had made on ancient reefs especially those in the Oolitic rocks might interest you and the inference I have drawn from your theory of subsidence may hold true of the bed of the Jurassic ocean. at all events it is a new explanation of the formation of the Oolitic strata and when we reflect on the enormous lapse of time that must have taken place to allow so many different forms of polyp life to appear and depart, as shewn by our tables, we have no difficulty in understanding how a slow subsidence of the bed of the Jurassic ocean would have allowed all those tropical forms which the Oolites contain to come in and go out ere the Jurassic drop scene fell.

A chief part was to be done to the Church (apart from the Chancel) for about £1100, and he asked me to give £50. I agreed on condition that not less than 1000 should be laid out. Hearing that the subscriptions were liberal and must interest taken, I hoped all proposed, and perhaps even more might be done, and sent an offer having promised £50 to 1000 that I would give £25 towards additional £500. I have a letter today from M Ffinden to say some objections and difficulties were raised at a vestry, that no apse, organ chamber, or other addition can be made, that the sum will be only £700, and to know if I will still give £50. So I ask for information and as orators say pause for a reply, asking you to tell me what is the matter and what the hitch is"
